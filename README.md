# Evolution-of-Time-Series-Analytics
This project conceptualizes the evolution of time series from 1980 to today’s world, from a time where forecasts were done using pen and paper to using A.I. Time Series Evolution potrays how statisticians and researchers came all the way from performing forecasting using linear regression to using state of the art deep learning models. This paper has a brief introduction about  the essence of time series analytics, its components, classical statistical smoothing methods such as Holt’s Winter &amp; SES, regression based models such as linear &amp; quadratic trend, general forecasting models such as ARIMA &amp; SARIMA to Advanced models such as LSTM’s and FB Prophet.
